## Project Analysis and Improvement Summary

### Initial Project State (Found Issues)

#### Critical Code Issues
- **`ui/app.js`**: Incomplete implementation with undefined variables (`state`, `el`) and missing core functions
- **`server/server.js`**: Basic Express server with minimal error handling and no logging
- **`Raspi5/camera/streamer.js`**: Incomplete camera streaming implementation with missing imports and error handling

#### Architecture Problems
- **No proper error handling**: Applications crash on errors without recovery
- **Missing logging**: No way to debug issues or monitor system health
- **Inconsistent configuration**: Environment variables not properly loaded
- **No database integration**: Events and motion data not persisted
- **Security vulnerabilities**: No authentication, exposed endpoints
- **Complex deployment**: Multiple scripts for different platforms, confusing setup

#### Reliability Issues
- **No health monitoring**: Cannot detect if services are running properly

- **Race conditions**: Concurrent access issues not handled
- **Network failures**: No reconnection logic for WebSocket or camera streams

#### User Experience Problems
